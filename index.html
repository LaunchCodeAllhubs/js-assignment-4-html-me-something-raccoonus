         <h1>Zacks Favorite Video Games</h1>
         <p>Today, I will be showing you my <b>favorite</b> video games throughout my childhood. 
            These games helped me through tough times, made great memories, and made me shed a few tears for the emotionally draining games.</p>

            <h2>The Sly Cooper Series</h2>
            <p> 
            This is one of the earlier memories I had playing a game made by the company <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a>.
            It was one of the first story games that really had me hooked since Sly Cooper and the Thievious Raccoonus which was the first game. The 3rd game was the <b>BEST</b> one and I will debate anyone on that!

            <h2>Jak and Daxter</h2>
            <p>
               Jak and Daxter, just like the game before, was developed by <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a> and once again hit a homerun here. You play as a boy who has a friend that gets turned into an ottsel
               (which is a hybird of an otter and weasel). Your quest is to stop the evil villains Gol and Maia from flooding the world with a substance called <b><em>Dark Eco</em></b>. Again, the 3rd game has a  different plot than the first, it's much more mature
               using weapons and vehicles, but the first one is where my love for the game started.

            <h2>The Last of Us</h2>
            <p>
               For anyone who has seen the show, or played the game, you know why this is on here. This game was created by, you guessed it, <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a>. Another reaon
               why they are my favorite gaming studio of all time. The Last of Us is a game that is set in a time where a fungal virus infects the entire world
               in a matter of days turning anyone who comes in contact with it into a living zombified host of the parasite. Joel and Ellie are the main characters in this game. Their relationship is rocky at first 
               for reasons.... <em>unknown</em> but as their relationship grows they start to become very close with one another taking the form of a father daugther type bond that never ceases to make me wish I could 
               replay this game or the watch the show again for the first time.

            <h2>God of War Ragnar√∂k</h2>
            <p>
               God of War was developed by <a href="https://sms.playstation.com/" target="_blank">Santa Monica Studios</a>. At the Game Awards 2022, it won awards for...
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Best Narrative</li>
               <li>Best Score and Music</li>
               <li>Best Audio Design</li>
               <li>Best Performance (Christopher Judge as Kratos)</li>
               <li>Innovation in Accessibility</li>
               <li>Best Action/Adventure</li>        
            </ul>
            <p>
               After playing the game, you will understand why such a game may receive all the noteworthy awards. It's a captivating story of a father who was 
               once the God of War develop this relationship with his son Atreus and the perils they endure to save the nine realms and find the missing giants.
