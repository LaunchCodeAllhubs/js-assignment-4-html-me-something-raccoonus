         <p>Today, I will be showing you my <b>favorite</b> video games throughout my childhood. 
            These games helped me through tough times, made great memories, and made me shed a few tears for the emotionally draining games.</p>

               <h2 style="font-style: italic">The Sly Cooper Series</h2>
               <p> 
                  This is one of the earlier memories I had playing a game made by the company <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a>.
                  It was one of the first story games that really had me hooked since Sly Cooper and the Thievious Raccoonus which was the first game. The 3rd game was the <b>BEST</b> one and I will debate anyone on that!

            <h2>Jak and Daxter</h2>
            <p>
               Jak and Daxter, just like the game before, was developed by <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a> and once again hit a homerun here. You play as a boy who has a friend that gets turned into an ottsel
               (which is a hybird of an otter and weasel). Your quest is to stop the evil villains Gol and Maia from flooding the world with a substance called <b><em>Dark Eco</em></b>. Again, the 3rd game has a  different plot than the first, it's much more mature
               using weapons and vehicles, but the first one is where my love for the game started.

            <h2>The Last of Us</h2>
            <p>
               For anyone who has seen the show, or played the game, you know why this is on here. This game was created by, you guessed it, <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a>. Another reaon
               why they are my favorite gaming studio of all time. The Last of Us is a game that is set in a time where a fungal virus infects the entire world
               in a matter of days turning anyone who comes in contact with it into a living zombified host of the parasite. Joel and Ellie are the main characters in this game. Their relationship is rocky at first 
               for reasons.... <em>unknown</em> but as their relationship grows they start to become very close with one another taking the form of a father daugther type bond that never ceases to make me wish I could 
               replay this game or the watch the show again for the first time.

            <h2>The Elder Scrolls: skyrim</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               A timeless classic created by <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard" target="_blank">Bethesda</a>. This game is based in a world where magic, dragons, and prophecies are real life. 
               You can create your own character with fully customizable facial features, race, and name. It's an open world game that has a main quest, but you often forget about that just given the sheer
               size of the world you are thrown into. With hundreds of different side missions and an almost infinite amount time you can spend in the game you create the character you want to be in the best RPG 
               game ever made. After being released 12 years ago, Skyrim fans have taken to modding the game with their own graphics, incorporating ChatGPT to non-player characters, and essentially adding onto an already 
               masterpiece. This allows the game to live on for so long and still have fans coming back to this game after so long.

            <h2>Starfield</h2>
            <p>
               As a little bonus here, Starfield has not been released yet. Another game made by <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard" target="_blank">Bethesda</a>. It is coming out this fall in just a few short months. It has been hyped up to surpass Skyrim given the 8+ years the game has been in development.
               CEO Todd Howard stated that this game will have 1000 different planets you can visit as you create your own starfaring character in an open world futuristic astronaut game.
