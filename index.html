         <h1>Zacks Favorite Video Games</h1>
         <p>Today, I will be showing you my <b>favorite</b> video games throughout my childhood. 
            These games helped me through tough times, made great memories, and made me shed a few tears for the emotionally draining games.</p>

            <h2>The Sly Cooper Series</h2>
            <p> 
            This is one of the earlier memories I had playing a game made by the company <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a>.
            It was one of the first story games that really had me hooked since Sly Cooper and the Thievious Raccoonus which was the first game. The 3rd game was the <b>BEST</b> one and I will debate anyone on that!

            <h2>Jak and Daxter</h2>
            <p>
               Jak and Daxter, just like the game before, was developed by <a href="http://www.naughtydog.com" target="_blank">Naughty Dog</a> and once again hit a homerun here. You play as a boy who has a friend that gets turned into an ottsel
               (which is a hybird of an otter and weasel). Your quest is to stop the evil villains Gol and Maia from flooding the world with a substance called <b><em>Dark Eco</em></b>. Again, the 3rd game has a  different plot than the first, it's much more mature
               using weapons and vehicles, but the first one is where my love for the game started.
